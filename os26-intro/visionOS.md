# visionOS 3.0 Developer Introduction

Apple Vision Pro offers an infinite canvas to explore, experiment, and play â€” giving you the freedom to completely rethink your app's spatial computing experience. Using familiar frameworks and tools, you can design and build an entirely new universe of apps and games for Vision Pro.

**Platform:** visionOS 3.0+

## Overview

visionOS 3.0 represents the future of spatial computing, enabling developers to create immersive experiences that seamlessly blend digital content with the physical world. This release introduces advanced spatial capabilities, enhanced performance, and new frameworks for building the next generation of applications.

## Key Features

### Spatial Computing

**A spectrum of immersion**  
Create experiences that range from familiar app windows to fully immersive environments. Transition smoothly between different levels of immersion based on user intent and context.

**3D Interface Design**  
Design interfaces that exist in three-dimensional space, allowing users to interact with content naturally using their eyes, hands, and voice.

**Spatial Positioning**  
Place content precisely in the user's environment, creating persistent spatial relationships that enhance usability and create magical experiences.

### Development Frameworks

**SwiftUI for visionOS**  
Build beautiful, compelling apps using familiar SwiftUI patterns enhanced for spatial computing. Create interfaces that automatically adapt to different immersion levels and spatial contexts.

**RealityKit Integration**  
Add depth and dimension to your applications with RealityKit. Create realistic 3D content, lighting, and physics that respond naturally to the user's environment.

**ARKit Capabilities**  
Understand your surroundings with advanced ARKit features. Access world tracking, plane detection, and occlusion to create spatially-aware experiences.

### User Interaction

**Eye and Hand Tracking**  
Leverage precise eye and hand tracking for intuitive, natural interactions. Users can look at objects to focus on them and use hand gestures to manipulate content.

**Voice Integration**  
Support Siri and voice commands for hands-free interaction, especially useful in immersive experiences where traditional touch interfaces aren't available.

**Accessibility Excellence**  
Create experiences that work for everyone with built-in accessibility features including VoiceOver for spatial interfaces and switch control support.

### Advanced Capabilities

**Immersive Environments**  
Transport users to entirely new worlds with full immersion experiences. Create environments that replace the user's surroundings for gaming, entertainment, and specialized applications.

**Shared Experiences**  
Enable multiple Vision Pro users to share the same spatial experience, perfect for collaboration, gaming, and social applications.

**Passthrough Integration**  
Seamlessly blend digital content with the real world using high-quality passthrough video that maintains spatial relationships.
