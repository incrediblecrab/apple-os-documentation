# Maps Web Snapshots

Create a static image of a map from a URL.

**Platforms:** Maps Web Snapshots 1.0+ (Beta)

## Overview

Use the Maps Web Snapshots service to generate static map images from a URL. You can use Snapshots any time that an interactive map isn't required, and in any place you typically use an image URL â€” in web pages, and in places where JavaScript isn't available, such as email clients.

**Note:** If you need an interactive map on the web, see MapKit JS. To generate static map snapshots in iOS, macOS, or tvOS apps, see MKMapSnapshotter.

To learn how to construct a signed and validated snapshot URL, see Generating a URL and Signature to Create a Maps Web Snapshot. You generate the required signature using credentials obtained through your Apple Developer account. See Creating a Maps identifier and a private key to learn how to get these credentials. You can also obtain HTML to show information about a place using Create a Map.

For more information on usage limits for Maps Web Snapshots, see the Apple Developer page, Maps on the Web.
