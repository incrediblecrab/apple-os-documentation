# EnergyKit

Provide a grid forecast for your app to help people choose when to use electricity.

**Platforms:** iOS 26.0+ *Beta* | iPadOS 26.0+ *Beta*

## Overview

EnergyKit provides a grid forecast for your app to help people choose when to use electricity. This forecast is personalized for each person's Home location and based on various environmental and grid inputs, and identifies the times when there's relatively cleaner electricity on the grid. A person's rate plan information is also incorporated when they have connected to their utility account in the Home App.

EnergyKit helps you build apps that people can use to manage their home devices' electricity usage to help support the transition to a cleaner electricity grid. It's meant for residential, behind-the-meter applications, such as electricity usage of household devices, appliances, and EV charging. It's not meant for commercial or industrial applications. The system is designed for initial use cases involving smart thermostats (HVAC) and EV charging.

Using EnergyKit, your app can:

- Shift a person's electricity usage to times when there's relatively cleaner electricity on the grid.
- Provide insights into device electricity consumption or runtime and give guidance on cleaner energy periods of time, as well as peak or off-peak utility cost periods when a person has connected to their electric utility provider and is on a time-varying rate.

> **Important:** Energy guidance is only available in the contiguous United States.

### Add the entitlement to your app

To use EnergyKit, the system requires your app to have the com.apple.developer.energykit entitlement with a value of true. Add this entitlement by enabling the EnergyKit capability on your app's target in Xcode. For more information, see Adding capabilities to your app.

> **Note:** The EnergyKit entitlement only supports development builds and Ad Hoc testing. The entitlement will support App Store submission and Test Flight at a later time.

## Topics

### Essentials
- [Optimizing home electricity usage](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/energykit/optimizing_home_electricity_usage) - Shift electric vehicle charging schedules to times when the grid is cleaner and potentially less expensive.
- **com.apple.developer.energykit** - The entitlement the system requires for an app to use the EnergyKit framework.

### Load events
To generate device electricity consumption or runtime insights, your app needs to provide the required usage data in the form of load events to EnergyKit.
- **ElectricHVACLoadEvent** - A measurement of the electricity consumed by an HVAC system.
- **ElectricVehicleLoadEvent** - A measurement of the electricity consumed or generated by an electric vehicle while connected to a charger.
- **EnergyVenue** - A physical site that uses or produces electricity at that location.
- **ElectricityFlowDirection** - Information about which direction the electricity moves.
- **ElectricalLoadEventProtocol** - A type that can represent an electrical load event.

### Guidance
- **ElectricityGuidance** - A data model that provides guidance on when electricity is cleaner and less expensive.

### Insights
- **ElectricityInsightRecord** - A structure that represents displayable environmental impact information for electricity usage.
- **ElectricityInsightService** - A service for retrieving insights about electricity consumption.
- **ElectricityInsightQuery** - A structure describing a query that you use to obtain environmental impact information in the form of electricity insight records.
- **ElectricityInsightMeasure** - A measurement of electricity consumption.

### Error response
- **EnergyKitError** - A specialized error that provides localized messages describing the error and why it occurred.

> **Beta Software:** This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
