# Safari Release Notes

Review Safari, embedded web-content, and Web Inspector changes. Check each API's platform availability separately; a web-engine change does not make every SafariServices or WebKit interface available on every Apple platform.

## Overview

> **Checked September 8, 2026:** Safari 27 remains beta. The [Safari 27 notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safari-release-notes/safari-27-release-notes) carry the header **July 20, 2026 — 27.0 beta (`20625.1.24`)**. Separately, [Apple's security list](https://support.apple.com/en-us/100100) records **Safari 26.6.1 for macOS Sonoma and Sequoia on August 18**. That standalone update is not the version of every OS-bundled WebKit build.

Safari is a web browser app and web technology platform available on iOS and macOS. It's built on WebKit, a fast, open-source web rendering engine that implements web standards. Safari includes Apple web innovations such as Intelligent Tracking Prevention, Reader mode, Safari App Extensions, and Web Inspector.

### Safari 27 Developer Checks

- The beta notes list availability on iOS/iPadOS/visionOS 27 beta, macOS 27 beta, **macOS 26**, and **macOS Sequoia**. Safari's host availability is not identical to the OS27 installation matrix.
- `ariaNotify` enables programmatic screen-reader announcements. Test announcement timing and accessibility rather than using it to replace meaningful document structure.
- CSS additions include `stretch` sizing, `:heading`, `:host:has()`, and additional color/anchor-positioning behavior. Feature-detect and test fallbacks for older Safari and embedded web views you support.
- Re-test the accessibility, layout, and animation issues marked resolved in the notes; a fixed beta issue is not an enduring web-platform restriction.
- Distinguish Safari product features, Safari extension capabilities, and APIs exposed through `WKWebView`. A browser feature announcement alone does not establish an embeddable API.
