## Overview

GameplayKit is an object-oriented framework that provides foundational tools and technologies for building games. GameplayKit includes tools for designing games with functional, reusable architecture, as well as technologies for building and enhancing gameplay features such as character movement and opponent behavior.

### Getting Started with GameplayKit

GameplayKit covers many aspects of game design and development. For deeper discussions of the game design patterns you can leverage with GameplayKit, along with tutorials that illustrate building games with GameplayKit features, see GameplayKit Programming Guide.

- **GKDecisionNode** - A node for use in manually creating decision trees, representing a specific question and possible answers, or an action that follows from answering other questions.

### Pathfinding
Create graphs that model the navigability of your game world, allowing GameplayKit to plan optimal routes for game characters to follow.
- **GKGraph** - A collection of nodes that describes the navigability of a game world and provides pathfinding methods to search for routes through that space.
- **GKObstacleGraph** - A navigation graph for 2D game worlds that creates a minimal network for precise pathfinding around obstacles.

- **GKGridGraphNode** - A node in a navigation graph, associated with a position on a discrete two-dimensional grid.

### Agents, Goals, and Behaviors
Add autonomous movement to characters and other game objects by combining high-level goals such as moving to a target, following a path, or avoiding obstacles.
- **GKAgent** - A component that moves a game entity according to a set of goals and realistic constraints.
- **GKAgent2D** - An agent that operates in a two-dimensional space.
- **GKAgent3D** - An agent that operates in a three-dimensional space.
