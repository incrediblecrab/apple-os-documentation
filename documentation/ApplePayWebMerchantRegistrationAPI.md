# Apple Pay Web Merchant Registration API

Manage merchant registration through your web platform.

**Platforms:** Apple Pay Web Merchant Registration API 1.0+

## Overview

The Apple Pay Web Merchant Registration API is a REST API that enables platform integrators such as payment-service providers and e-commerce platforms to register web merchants who want to offer Apple Pay on the web.

As a platform integrator, you manage Apple Pay configuration on the merchants' behalf when you call Register Merchant. Merchants aren't required to set up an Apple Developer account or configure their own keys and certificates â€” you set up a shared set of keys and certificates for your entire merchant portfolio. Register merchants with their own website domains, or with web pages hosted by your platform.

Note: This API is available in production and in sandbox environments. To use this API in the sandbox environment, call the endpoints using the domain apple-pay-gateway-cert.apple.com. For example, the sandbox endpoint for Register Merchant is: POST https://apple-pay-gateway-cert.apple.com/paymentservices/registerMerchant.
