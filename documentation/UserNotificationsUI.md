# User Notifications UI

Customize the interface that displays local and remote notifications.

**Platforms:** iOS 10.0+ | iPadOS 10.0+ | Mac Catalyst 14.0+ | macOS 11.0+ | visionOS 1.0+

## Overview

Customize how local and remote notifications appear on the user's device by adding a notification content app extension to the bundle of your iOS app. Your extension manages a custom view controller, which you use to present the content from incoming notifications. When a notification arrives, the system displays your view controller in addition to, or in place of, the default system interface.
