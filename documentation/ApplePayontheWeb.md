# Apple Pay on the Web

Support Apple Pay on your website with JavaScript-based APIs.

**Platforms:** Safari Desktop 10.0+ | Safari Mobile 10.0+

## Overview

Safari supports two JavaScript APIs that let you accept Apple Pay payments from customers on your website:

- Payment Request API, a W3C candidate API
- Apple Pay JS API, analogous to the PassKit (Apple Pay and Wallet) framework for Apple Pay in apps.

Tip: You can try out Apple Pay transactions on the demo page. See Apple Pay on the Web Interactive Demo.

Apple Pay is available on all iOS devices with a Secure Element â€” an industry-standard, certified chip designed to store payment information safely. In macOS, users must have an Apple Pay-capable iPhone or Apple Watch to authorize the payment, or a Mac with Touch ID.

### Apple Pay availability by region and platform

Apple Pay is available in supported regions.

The Apple Pay APIs are available in Safari on the following platforms:

| API | Worldwide (except China) | China |
|-----|-------------------------|--------|
| Apple Pay JS | iOS 10 and later<br>macOS 10.12 and later | iOS 11.2 and later<br>(Not available in macOS) |
| Payment Request API | iOS 11.3 and later<br>macOS 10.12.6 and later, in Safari 11.1 and later | iOS 11.3 and later<br>(Not available in macOS) |

In iOS, Safari and SFSafariViewController objects support Apple Pay.

See Checking for Apple Pay availability to ensure your implementation only displays the Apple Pay button on supported devices.

Note: Regulations in some regions may require specific configurations in your implementation. For more information, see Complying with regional regulations.
