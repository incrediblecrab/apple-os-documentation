# ManagedAppDistribution

Manage the distribution of apps within an organization.

**Platforms:** iOS 17.2+ | iPadOS 17.2+

## Overview
Managed apps are featured, downloadable apps that an enterprise, educational, or other institution provides to its employees or students. The Managed App Distribution framework allows developers of device management solutions to vend these managed apps. The framework verifies that someone initiated an app installation, provides status and download progress, and can launch the app once itâ€™s downloaded.

Important

The Managed App Installation UI entitlement is required to use this framework.

The Managed App Distribution framework works with declarative management to provide a list of managed apps that are assigned to a device. Your app can sort or filter the list of managed apps, and request a view from the Managed App Distribution framework to display. See Integrating Declarative Management for more information.
