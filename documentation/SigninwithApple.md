# Sign in with Apple

Provide users the ability to sign in to your apps and websites using their Apple ID.

**Platforms:** Sign in with Apple JS 1.0+ | Sign in with Apple REST API 1.0+

## Overview

Sign in with Apple gives your users a fast and safe way to sign in to your apps and websites using their Apple ID. Incorporating Sign in with Apple eliminates the need for additional sign-up steps, allowing users to engage and focus on your app or website.

Sign in with Apple at Work & School provides the same ease of use for users with managed Apple IDs in Apple School Manager (ASM) or Apple Business Manager (ABM).

**Note:** Administrators can configure Access Management controls for Sign in with Apple at Work & School within Apple Business Manager and Apple School Manager.

To support Sign in with Apple for iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS apps, see Implementing User Authentication with Sign in with Apple. For website support, see **Sign in with Apple JS**, and use the **Sign in with Apple REST API** to communicate with Apple servers.
