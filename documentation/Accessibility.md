# Accessibility

Make your apps accessible to everyone who uses Apple devices.

**Platforms:** iOS 14.0+ | iPadOS 14.0+ | Mac Catalyst 14.0+ | macOS 11.0+ | tvOS 14.0+ | visionOS 1.0+ | watchOS 7.0+

## Overview

Accessibility features help a wide range of people interact with their devices. By creating your app with accessibility in mind, you make it possible for everyone to enjoy your app. Whether you're developing a new app, or updating an existing one, consider the needs of all the people who might use your app.

For many, accessibility is a necessity. For others, it's a practicality. For example, closed captions can be necessary for someone who is deaf or hard of hearing, but also useful for someone watching a video in a noisy environment. Learn more about how to support different types of accessibility needs in your app using Apple's wide range of accessibility APIs.

### Accessibility Domains

**Vision**  
A person may be blind or color blind, or have a vision challenge that makes focusing difficult.

**Speech**  
A person may have a speech disability or prefer to connect without using their voice.

**Mobility**  
A person with reduced mobility may have difficulty holding a device or tapping the interface.

**Cognitive**  
A person may have difficulty remembering a sequence of steps, or they may find an overly complex user interface difficult to process and manage.

**Hearing**  
A person may be deaf, have partial hearing loss, or have difficulty hearing sounds within a certain range.

### Assistive Technologies

People can personalize their devices by choosing the accessibility features and assistive technologies that give them the best user experience. Make sure your app provides a great experience for people who use assistive technologies by testing your app with them.

**VoiceOver**  
A gesture-based screen reader that provides an auditory description of the content onscreen.

**Voice Control**  
An interface for navigating a device using voice commands to tap, swipe, type, and more.

**Switch Control**  
An interface for navigating a device with a variety of adaptive switch hardware, wireless game controllers, or sounds such as a click or a pop.

**Assistive Access**  
A mode that tailors the iOS and iPadOS experience for people with cognitive disabilities.

### Accessibility Nutrition Labels

You can add Accessibility Nutrition Labels to your App Store product page to indicate which accessibility features your app supports on each platform. For example, a person who is blind or has low vision might seek apps that support VoiceOver or Larger Text.

For more information on adding Accessibility Nutrition Labels to your app, see Overview of Accessibility Nutrition Labels in App Store Connect Help.
