# MapKit JS

Embed interactive Apple Maps on your website, annotate points of interest, and perform georelated searches.

**Platforms:** MapKit JS 5.0+

## Overview

Use this JavaScript API to embed interactive maps directly into your webpages or apps across different platforms and operating systems, including iOS and Android. Like MapKit for native apps, you can also add annotations and overlays to the map to call out points of interest or user destinations.

MapKit JS also provides interactive views for place details, and Look Around imagery.

MapKit JS requires authorization through a Maps token for initialization and some API calls. To create a Maps token, see Creating a Maps token.
