# Boxes

A box creates a visually distinct group of logically related information and components.

**Platforms:** iOS | iPadOS | macOS | visionOS

## Overview

By default, a box uses a visible border or background color to separate its contents from the rest of the interface. A box can also include a title.

## Topics

### Best Practices

- **Prefer keeping a box relatively small in comparison with its containing view** - As a box's size gets close to the size of the containing window or screen, it becomes less effective at communicating the separation of grouped content, and it can crowd other content.
- **Consider using padding and alignment to communicate additional grouping within a box** - A box's border is a distinct visual element â€” adding nested boxes to define subgroups can make your interface feel busy and constrained.

### Content

- **Provide a succinct introductory title if it helps clarify the box's contents** - The appearance of a box helps people understand that its contents are related, but it might make sense to provide more detail about the relationship. Also, a title can help VoiceOver users predict the content they encounter within the box.
- **If you need a title, write a brief phrase that describes the contents** - Use sentence-style capitalization. Avoid ending punctuation unless you use a box in a settings pane, where you append a colon to the title.

### Platform Considerations

**iOS, iPadOS**  
- By default, iOS and iPadOS use the secondary and tertiary background colors in boxes.

**macOS**  
- By default, macOS displays a box's title above it.

**visionOS**  
- No additional considerations.

**tvOS, watchOS**  
- Not supported.
