# Image Wells

An image well is an editable version of an image view.

**Platforms:** macOS

## Overview

After selecting an image well, people can copy and paste its image or delete it. People can also drag a new image into an image well without selecting it first.

## Topics

### Best Practices

- **Revert to a default image when necessary** - If your image well requires an image, display the default image again if people clear the content of the image well.
- **Make sure the standard copy and paste menu items are available** - People generally expect to choose these menu items — or use the standard keyboard shortcuts — to interact with an image well. For guidance, see Edit menu.

### Platform Considerations

Not supported in iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, visionOS, or watchOS.
